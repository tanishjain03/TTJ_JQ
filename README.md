This is a basic JavaScript code which implements some of the JQuery functions.
You can use integrate this code and make modals and accordians. AXAJ code is also implemented, so you just have to provide some information to the ajax function in JSON format and ajax calls will be made.

Just copy the code in some JavaScript file and add it to your project.
